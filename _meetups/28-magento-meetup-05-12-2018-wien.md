The last meetup of this year will be held in Vienna, featuring two interesting talks by two speakers doing their first
Magento Meetup Austria talk. Welcome to the family!

For our first talk, Stephan is coming all the way from Mannheim to tell us about building a Continous Delivery Pipeline
for Magento:
 
> Continuous Delivery Pipeline as code is key helping you to ensure longterm maintainability.
> Treating your pipeline as code helps you to version it in your SCM of choice, makes changes easily traceable and lets
> anyone on your team make required changes.
> 
> In this session I will show you how we build and maintain our Continuous Delivery pipeline using tools like GitLab CI,
> Docker, Nexus and Traefik. Together we will take a deep dive into the GitLab CI Build Pipelines to build and deploy
> docker containers to dev, stage and production environments.
