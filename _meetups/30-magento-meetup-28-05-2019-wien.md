Hi!

Again, we have something to celebrate: this is our **30th Magento Meetup** in Austria. A BIG thank you to everybody
making this possible!

This time, we are meeting in **Vienna** in the 17th district in the LimeSoda office. We are looking forward to welcome
many attendees!

Our first talk will be held by **Tsvetan Stoychev**. Tsvetan will talk about Web Performance Metrics and give us
examples from production Magento shops:

> DON'T GUESS. MEASURE.", I've been looking at this slogan on a office wall every work day during last 2 years. By
> chance I became interested in Web Performance optimizations about 2 years ago and since today I still keep repeating
> to myself "DON'T GUESS. MEASURE." before and after I improve performance.
> 
> Measuring results before and after performance optimization is essential. It keeps our projects healthy, ensures
> that we do not create a performance regression and helps us find out the next performance bottleneck.
> 
> In this talk I would like to share:
> 
> * Some of the interesting fronted performance metrics?
> * How can we track those metrics?
> * What I've learned about performance monitoring? As a bonus I will demonstrate
>   [Basic RUM](https://github.com/basicrum/backoffice) an open source project that helps developers track frontend
>   performance. Of course all this knowledge was gained while monitoring and auditing custom Magento 1.x themes.

Thank you a lot for giving this talk, Tsvetan!
