In his first public talk ever (thanks for taking the plunge with us!),
[Ivan Cuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-cuk/) will tell us about:

* Challenges and advantages of having team members who work remotely 
* How the home office option is influencing the efficiency of the whole team
* The traditional inhouse approach and difficulties with finding talent in the IT industry

Another first-time speaker at our meetup is Konrad Androsch from the Austrian hoster
[internex.at](https://www.internex.at/). Please tell us beforehand which performance/scaling problems you are having
with Magento 2! Konrad will show ways to solve them.

Many thanks to <a href="https://www.limesoda.com/">LimeSoda</a> for providing us with food, drinks and the location.
