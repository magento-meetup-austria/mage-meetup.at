<h2>The talks</h2>

<h4>Language</h4>
<p>We are happy about talks in German or English. Please tell us what you prefer.</p>

<h4>Length</h4>
<p>Between 20 and 30 minutes are perfect. Sometimes, you might get some questions / discussions and we try to have time
for 2 talks at a meetup usually. If you want to talk longer or shorter, please tell  us.</p>

<h4>Info that we need</h4>
<p>Please send us this info so we can tell everybody about your awesome talk: title, a short description (2 or 3
sentences) and any websites / social media profiles you would like us to link to.</p>

<h4>Recordings</h4>
<p>Sometimes, we record the talks or do a live streaming. If we plan to do so, we will ask you in advance. If you don't
like to be recorded, don't be afraid to say so :)</p>

<h4>Slides</h4>
<p>It would be great if you upload your slides somewhere after the talk and send us the link so we can link them on our
website.</p>
